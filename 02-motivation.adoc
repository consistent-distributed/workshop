= Motivation for asynchronous communication and eventual consistency

Contents: From what has been discussed in the previous part, make people aware of the driving forces behind asynchronous communication and eventual consistency.


== distributed system, distributed transactions
- as seen, communication within distributed systems can be a motivation to loosen up consistency requirements

== data growth
- data unable to fit into a single database instance
- need to scale databases

== scalability, on database side
- requirement to provision multiple database instances to accommodate load
- need to scale databases

== connection to real world (collaboration required, trust on outdated information, compensating use cases)
- explanation how the real world is eventually consistent
- building systems that solve real-world use cases might also require to take into account eventual consistency
